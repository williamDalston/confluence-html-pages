  <h2>Welcome & Purpose</h2>

  <p>
    Welcome to the <strong>ASPA HHS Analytics – Power BI & Data Engineering</strong> workspace! 
    This Confluence space serves as the central knowledge hub for all Power BI activities, analytics workflows, 
    and data modeling supporting the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ASPA project.
  </p>

  <p>
    This space is designed to create a unified, well-documented environment where the analytics team 
    can collaborate, share standards, accelerate development, and prepare for executive-level reporting 
    to HHS leadership.
